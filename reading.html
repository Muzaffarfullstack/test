              <p>
                Floods can occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the
                capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders
                in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and
                businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers.
                While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away
                from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally
                lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and
                fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to
                commerce and industry.
              </p>

              <p>
                A FIRE and flood are two of humanity's worst nightmares. People
                have, therefore, always sought to control them. Forest fires are
                snuffed out quickly. The flow of rivers is regulated by weirs
                and dams. At least, that is how it used to be. But foresters
                have learned that forests need fires to clear out the brush and
                even to get seeds to germinate. And a similar revelation is now
                dawning on hydrologists. Rivers – and the ecosystems they
                support – need floods. That is why a man-made torrent has been
                surging down the Grand Canyon. By Thursday, March 6th it was
                running at full throttle, which was expected to be sustained for
                60 hours.
              </p>

              <p>
                Floods once raged through the canyon every year. Spring snow
                from as far away as Wyoming would melt and swell the Colorado
                river to a flow that averaged around 1,500 cubic metres (50,000
                cubic feet) a second. Every eight years or so, that figure rose
                to almost 3,000 cubic metres. These floods infused the river
                with sediment, carved its beaches and built its sandbars.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, in the four decades since the building of the Glen
                Canyon dam, just upstream of the Grand Canyon, the only sediment
                that it has collected has come from tiny, undammed tributaries.
                Even that has not been much use as those tributaries are not
                powerful enough to distribute the sediment in an ecologically
                valuable way.
              </p>

              <p>
                This lack of flooding has harmed local wildlife. The humpback
                chub, for example, thrived in the rust-red waters of Colorado.
                Recently, though, its population has crashed. At first sight, it
                looked as if the reason was that the chub were being eaten by
                trout introduced for sport fishing in the mid-20th century. But
                trout and chub co-existed until the Glen Canyon dam was built,
                so something else is going on. Steve Gloss, of the United States
                Geological Survey (USGS), reckons that the chub's decline is the
                result of their losing their most valuable natural defense,
                Colorado's rusty sediment. The chub were well adapted to the
                poor visibility created by the thick, red water which gave the
                river its name and depended on it to hide from predators.
                Without the cloudy water, the chub became vulnerable.
              </p>

              <p>
                And the chub are not alone. In the years since the Glen Canyon
                dam was built, several species have vanished altogether. These
                include the Colorado pike-minnow, the razorback sucker and the
                roundtail chub. Meanwhile, aliens including fathead minnows,
                channel catfish and common carp, which would have been hard put
                to survive in the savage waters of the undammed canyon, have
                moved in.
              </p>

              <p>
                So flooding is the obvious answer. Unfortunately, it is easier
                said than done. Floods were sent down the Grand Canyon in 1996
                and 2004 and the results were mixed. In 1996 the flood was
                allowed to go on too long. To start with, all seemed well. The
                floodwaters built up sandbanks and infused the river with
                sediment. Eventually, however, the continued flow washed most of
                the sediment out of the canyon. This problem was avoided in
                2004, but unfortunately, on that occasion, the volume of sand
                available behind the dam was too low to rebuild the sandbanks.
                This time, the USGS is convinced that things will be better. The
                amount of sediment available is three times greater than it was
                in 2004. So if a flood is going to do some good, this is the
                time to unleash one.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even so, it may turn out to be an empty gesture. At less than
                1,200 cubic metres a second, this flood is smaller than even an
                average spring flood, let alone one of the mightier deluges of
                the past. Those glorious inundations moved massive quantities of
                sediment through the Grand Canyon, wiping the slate dirty, and
                making a muddy mess of silt and muck that would make modern
                river rafters cringe.

                <strong>A</strong> <br />
                Aging, it is now clear, is part of an ongoing maturation process
                that all our organs go through. "In a sense, aging is keyed to
                the level of the vigor of the body and the continuous
                interaction between levels of body activity and levels of mental
                activity," reports Arnold B. Scheibel, M.D., whose very academic
                title reflects how once far-flung domains now converge on the
                mind and the brain. Scheibel is a professor of anatomy, cell
                biology, psychiatry, and behavioral sciences at the University
                of California at Los Angeles, and director of university's Brain
                Research Institute. Experimental evidence has backed up popular
                assumptions that the aging mind undergoes decay analogous to
                that of the aging body. Younger monkeys, chimps, and lower
                animals consistently outperform their older colleagues on memory
                tests. In humans, psychologists concluded, memory and other
                mental functions deteriorate over time because of inevitable
                organic changes in the brain as neurons die off. The mental
                decline after young adulthood appeared inevitable.

                Equipped with imaging techniques that capture the brain in
                action, Stanley Rapoport, Ph.D., at the National Institutes of
                Health, measured the flow of blood in the brains of old and
                young people as they went through the task of matching photos of
                faces. Since blood flow reflects neuronal activity, Rapoport
                could compare with networks of neurons were being used by
                different subjects. "Even when the reaction times of older and
                younger subjects were the same, the neural networks they used
                were significantly different. The older subjects were using
                different internal strategies to accomplish the same result in
                the same time," Rapoport says. Either the task required greater
                effort on the part of the older subjects or the work of neurons
                originally involved in tasks of that type had been taken over by
                other neurons, creating different networks.

                <strong>C</strong><br />
                At the Georgia Institute of Technology, psychologist Timothy
                Salthouse, Ph.D., compared a group of very fast and accurate
                typists of college-age with another group in their 60s. since
                reaction time is faster in younger people and most people's
                fingers grow less nimble with age, younger typists might be
                expected to tap right along while the older one's fumble. But
                both typed 60 words a minute. The older typists, it turned out,
                achieved their speed with cunning little strategies that made
                them far more efficient than their younger counterparts: They
                made fewer finger movements, saving a fraction of a second here
                and there. They also read ahead in the text. The neural networks
                involved in typing appear to have been reshaped to compensate
                for losses in motor skills or other age changes.

                "When a rat is kept in isolation without playmates or objects to
                interact with, the animal's brain shrinks, but if we put that
                rat with 11 other rats in a large cage and give them an
                assortment of wheels, ladders, and other toys, we can show—after
                four days—significant differences in its brain," says Diamond,
                professor of integrative biology. Proliferating dendrites first
                appear in the visual association areas. After a month in the
                enriched environment, the whole cerebral cortex has expanded, a
                has its blood supply. Even in the enriched environment, rats get
                bored unless the toys are varied. "Animals are just like we are.
                They need stimulation," says Diamond. <br />
                <br />
                One of the most profoundly important mental functions is
                memory-notorious for its failure with age. So important is a
                memory that the Charles A. Dana foundation recently spent $8.4
                million to set up a consortium of leading medical centers to
                measure memory loss and aging through brain-imaging technology,
                neurochemical experiment, and cognitive and psychological tests.
                One thing, however, is already fairly clear—many aspects of
                memory are not a function of age at all but of education. Memory
                exists in more than one form. What we call knowledge—facts—is
                what psychologists such as Harry P. Bahrick, Ph.D., of Ohio
                Wesleyan University call semantic memory. Events, conversations,
                and occurrences in time and space, on the other hand, make up
                episodic or event memory, which is triggered by cues from the
                context. If you were around in 1963 you don't need to be
                reminded of the circumstances surrounding the moment you heard
                that JFK had been assassinated. That event is etched into your
                episodic memory.

                <strong>E</strong><br />
                When you forget a less vivid item, like buying a roll of paper
                towels at the supermarket, you may blame it on your aging
                memory. It's true that episodic memory begins to decline when
                most people are in their 50s, but it's never perfect at any age.
                "Every memory begins as an event," says Bahrick. "Through
                repetition, certain events leave behind a residue of knowledge
                or semantic memory. On a specific day in the past, somebody
                taught you that two and two are four, but you've been over that
                information so often you don't remember where you learned it.
                What started as an episodic memory has become a permanent part
                of your knowledge base." You remember the content, not the
                context. Our language knowledge, our knowledge of the world and
                of people, is largely that permanent or semi-permanent residue.

                <strong>F</strong><br />
                Probing the longevity of knowledge, Bahrick tested 1,000 high
                school graduates to see how well they recalled their algebra.
                Some had completed the course as recently as a month before,
                others as long as 50 years earlier. He also determined how long
                each person had studied algebra, the grade received, and how
                much the skill was used over the course of adulthood.
                Surprisingly, a person's grasp of algebra at the time of testing
                did not depend on how long ago he'd taken the course—the
                determining factor was the duration of instruction. Those who
                had spent only a few months learning algebra forgot most of it
                within two or three years.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>G</strong><br />In another study, Bahrick discovered
                that people who had taken several courses in Spanish, spread out
                over a couple of years, could recall, decades later, 60 per cent
                or more of the vocabulary they learned. Those who took just one
                course retained only a trace after three years. "This long-term
                residue of knowledge remains stable over the decades,
                independent of the age of the person and the age of the memory.
                No serious deficit appears until people get to their 50s and
                60s, probably due to the degenerative processes of aging rather
                than a cognitive loss."

                "You could say metamemory is a byproduct of going to school,"
                says psychologist Robert Kail, Ph.D., of Purdue University, who
                studies children from birth to 20 years, the time of life when
                mental development is most rapid. "The question-and-answer
                process, especially exam-taking, helps children learn—and also
                teaches them how their memory works. This may be one reason why,
                according to a broad range of studies in people over 60, the
                better educated a person is, the more likely they are to perform
                better in life and on psychological tests. A group of adult
                novice chess players were compared with a group of child experts
                at the game. In tests of their ability to remember a random
                series of numbers, the adults, as expected, outscored the
                children. But when asked to remember the patterns of chess
                pieces arranged on a board, the children won. "Because they'd
                played a lot of chess, their knowledge of chess was better
                organized than that of the adults, and their existing knowledge
                of chess served as a framework for new memory," explains Kail.

                Specialized knowledge is a mental resource that only improve
                with time. Crystallized intelligence about one's occupation
                apparently does not decline at all until at least age 75, and if
                there is no disease or dementia, may remain even longer. Special
                knowledge is often organized by a process called "chunking." If
                procedure A and procedure B are always done together, for
                example, the mind may merge them into a single command. When you
                apply yourself to a specific interest—say, cooking—you build
                increasingly elaborate knowledge structures that let you do more
                and do it better. This ability, which is tied to experience, is
                the essence of expertise. Vocabulary is one such specialized
                form of accrued knowledge. Research clearly shows that
                vocabulary improves with time. Retired professionals, especially
                teachers and journalists, consistently score higher on tests of
                vocabulary and general information than college students, who
                are supposed to be in their mental prime.

                "Obviously we must do some serious rethinking of our priorities,
                lest linguistics go down in history as the only science that
                presided obviously over the disappearance of 90 percent of the
                very field to which it is dedicated." – Michael Krauss, "The
                World's Languages in Crisis".
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Ten years ago Michael Krauss sent a shudder through the
                discipline of linguistics with his prediction that half the
                6,000 or so languages spoken in the world would cease to be
                uttered within a century. Unless scientists and community
                leaders directed a worldwide effort to stabilize the decline of
                local languages, he warned, nine-tenths of the linguistic
                diversity of humankind would probably be doomed to extinction.
                Krauss's prediction was little more than an educated guess, but
                other respected linguists had been clanging out similar alarms.
                Keneth L. Hale of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                noted in the same journal issue that eight languages on which he
                had done fieldwork had since passed into extinction. A 1990
                survey in Australia found that 70 of the 90 surviving Aboriginal
                languages were no longer used regularly by all age groups. The
                same was true for all but 20 of the 175 Native American
                languages spoken or remembered in the US., Krauss told a
                congressional panel in 1992.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Many experts in the field mourn the loss of rare languages, for
                several reasons. To start, there is scientific self-interest:
                some of the most basic questions in linguistics have to do with
                the limits of human speech, which are far from fully explored.
                Many researchers would like to know which structural elements of
                grammar and vocabulary – if any – are truly universal and
                probably, therefore, hardwired into the human brain. Other
                scientists try to reconstruct ancient migration patterns by
                comparing borrowed words that appear in otherwise unrelated
                languages. In each of these cases, the wider the portfolio of
                languages you study, the more likely you are to get the right
                answers
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Despite the near-constant buzz in linguistics about endangered
                languages over the past 10 years, the field has accomplished
                depressingly little. "You would think that there would be some
                organized response to this dire situation," some attempt to
                determine which language can be saved and which should be
                documented before they disappear, says Sarah G. Thomason, a
                linguist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. "But there
                isn't any such effort organized in the profession. It is only
                recently that it has become fashionable enough to work on
                endangered languages." Six years ago, recalls Douglas H. Whalen
                of Yale University, "when I asked linguists who were raising
                money to deal with these problems, I mostly got blank stares."
                So Whalen and a few other linguists founded the Endangered
                Languages Fund. In the five years to 2001, they were able to
                collect only $80,000 for research grants. A similar foundation
                in England, directed by Nicholas Ostler, has raised just $8,000
                since 1995.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                But there are encouraging signs that the field has turned a
                corner. The Volkswagen Foundation, a German charity, just issued
                its second round of grants totaling more than $2 million. It has
                created a multimedia archive at the Max Planck Institute for
                Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands that can house recordings,
                grammars, dictionaries and other data on endangered languages.
                To fill the archive, the foundation has dispatched field
                linguists to document Aweti (100 or so speakers in Brazil), Ega
                (about 300 speakers in Ivory Coast), Waima'a (a few hundred
                speakers in East Timor), and a dozen or so other languages
                unlikely to survive the century. The Ford Foundation has also
                edged into the arena. Its contributions helped to reinvigorate a
                master-apprentice program created in 1992 by Leanne Hinton of
                Berkeley and Native Americans worried about the imminent demise
                of about 50 indigenous languages in California. Fluent speakers
                receive $3,000 to teach a younger relative (who is also paid)
                their native tongue through 360 hours of shared activities,
                spread over six months. So far about 5 teams have completed the
                program, Hinton says, transmitting a least some knowledge of 25
                languages. "It's too early to call this language
                revitalization," Hinton admits. "In California, the death rate
                of elderly speakers will always be greater than the recruitment
                rate of young speakers. But at least we prolong the survival of
                the language." That will give linguists more time to record
                these tongues before they vanish.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                But the master-apprentice approach hasn't caught on outside the
                U.S., and Hinton's effort is a drop in the sea. At least 440
                languages have been reduced to a mere handful of elders,
                according to the Ethnologue, a catalogue of languages produced
                by the Dallas-based group SIL International that comes closest
                to global coverage. For the vast majority of these languages,
                there is little or no record of their grammar, vocabulary,
                pronunciation or use in daily life. Even if a language has been
                fully documented, all that remains once it vanishes from active
                use is a fossil skeleton, a scattering of features that the
                scientist was lucky and astute enough to capture. Linguists may
                be able to sketch an outline of the forgotten language and fix
                its place on the evolutionary tree, but little more. "How did
                people start conversations and talk to babies? How dis husbands
                and wives converse?" Hinton asks. "Those are the first things
                you want to learn when you want to revitalize the language."
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                But there is as yet no discipline of "conservation linguistics,"
                as there is for biology. Almost every strategy tried so far has
                succeeded in some places but failed in others, and there seems
                to be no way to predict with certainty what will work where.
                Twenty years ago in New Zealand, Maori speakers set up "language
                nests," in which preschoolers were immersed in the native
                language. Additional Maori-only classes were added as the
                children progressed through elementary and secondary school. A
                similar approach was tried in Hawaii, with some success – the
                number of native speakers has stabilized at 1,000 or so, reports
                Joseph E. Grimes of SIL International, who is working on Oahu.
                Students can now get instruction in Hawaiian all the way through
                university.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                One factor that always seems to occur in the demise of a
                language is that the speakers begin to have collective doubts
                about the usefulness of language loyalty. Once they start
                regarding their own language as inferior to the majority
                language, people stop using it in all situations. Kids pick up
                on the attitude and prefer the dominant language. In many cases,
                people don't notice until they suddenly realize that their kids
                never speak the language, even at home. This is how Cornish and
                some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is still only rarely used for
                daily home life in Ireland, 80 years after the republic was
                founded with Irish as its first official language.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Linguists agree that ultimately, the answer to the problem of
                language extinction is multilingualism. Even uneducated people
                can learn several languages, as long as they start as children.
                Indeed, most people in the world speak more than one tongue, and
                in places such as Cameroon (279 languages), Papua New Guinea
                (823) and India (387) it is common to speak three of four
                distinct languages and a dialect or two as well. Most Americans
                and Canadians, to the west of Quebec, have a gut reaction that
                anyone speaking another language in front of them is committing
                an immoral act. You get the same reaction in Australia and
                Russia. It is no coincidence that these are the areas where
                languages are disappearing the fastest. The first step in saving
                dying languages is to persuade the world's majorities to allow
                the minorities among them to speak with their own voices.
